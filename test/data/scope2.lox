// This test doesn't yet do the right thing.
//
// The problem is similar to the one in Crafting Interpreters chapter 11 ("Resolving and Binding").
// In JLox, the problem is that the Environment is being mutably updated every time a new variable is defined.
// This means that redefining a variable in the same block level secretly **overwrites**, rather than **shadows**,
// the existing variable.
//
// In HLox, however, we never mutate the Environment, just construct a new one. That solves the problem JLox has.
// However, this creates a new problem: whenever a variable is written to, it is secretly **shadowed**, rather
// than **overwritten**.
